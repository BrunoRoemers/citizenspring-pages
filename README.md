# Citizen Spring Pages

Create a quick website for your citizen initiative that anyone in your community can edit using Google Docs.

## Why?

I'm involved in many different collectives / citizen initiatives / communities and I often ran into the issue of "how can I quickly create a website that anyone in the community can edit?".

Turns out, the easiest tool for everone to use is Google Docs.
So I built a small engine to publish Google Docs in a nicer way.

## Features

**Allow anyone to make suggestions**
Just share your Google Doc with the permission to allow anyone to comment and make suggestions and now anyone can help you write or improve the content of your website. Only once an editor accepts the suggestions that they will be published on the website.

**Mobile friendly**

**Image optimization**
All images are automatically optimized for mobile or desktop.

**Embeds**
Automatically embed YouTube, Vimeo and Loom videos and tweets and GetRevue (just add the full URL in a new line)

**Custom domains**
